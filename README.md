Simple To-Do List app built with Ionic and Angular.  
It lets you:
- add tasks
- mark them done/undone
- delete them
- save tasks locally (Ionic Storage)
- choose a priority color (yellow / orange / red)

- *I had an issue with auth when trying to push from github to vs code - i ended up having to use tokens and repushing my commits
